# postcodeDistanceTest
For some reason not too long ago, I was looking at postcodes. Apparently postcodes have a lot more information included in them than I first thought.
e.g. Area: GU, District: 34, Sector: 4, Unit: DA = GU34 4DA
I wondered if this information could be used to see what's near you. It's not perfect, but it works.
I used a GeoJSON file made from a website called "http://overpass-turbo.eu/"; it took a while but I got all the restaurants (that the program had) in a file in the UK.
